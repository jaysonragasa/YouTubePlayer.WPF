# YouTube Player
This is a very simple YouTube player that stays on top on every windows and taskbar. It uses CefSharp as a WebBrowser control.

[CefSharp](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp) lets you embed Chromium in .NET apps. It is a lightweight .NET wrapper around the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) by Marshall A. Greenblatt. About 30% of the bindings are written in C++/CLI with the majority of code here is C#. It can be used from C# or VB, or any other CLR language. CefSharp provides both WPF and WinForms web browser control implementations.
